# Website
The Date Atelier allows the user (i.e., Lexi) to schedule a date and customize certain details to their liking (e.g., time, date, activities, location, food,  gifts, payment method). Upon confirmation of their booking, a plain-text (tentative) message will be sent to the organizer's (i.e., Justin) email.

# Sections
This chapter outlines the different sections of the website and their respective components.

### Homepage
This section is descriptive in nature. It will explain the rationale and functions of the website.


### Date Planner
This chapter outlines the primary function of the website: planning a date. A date contains several details which the user can customize to their liking, based on the provided options. There is also a budget aspect to the website planner. The user is given a monetary allowance for the date. Each option has its own price. This chapter also explains the options available for each aspect of the date.

### Statistics
This chapter—as well as the next—have serve little to no function and merely serve as comedic relief for the user.

### Activities and Locations
This is the central part of any date. The user needs to pick a minimum of one activity they'd like to do. Every time an activity is selected, options appear for each activity. A user can only select one option per activity.

### Outfit
Of course, no romantic date between couples is complete without a matching outfit! Please pick one according to your liking, and Justin will do his absolute best to match (even if it means buying new clothes, which he'll gladly do).

### Gifts
• Fuggler
• Ricky
• Heated Rivalry jersey
• (TBD) Issy Lip bait (Good Girl / Salty)
• BTS World Tour 2026 Manila tickets
• Steamdeck
• Leon Kennedy

### Date and Time
The user is subject to only two restrictions when choosing the time and date: first, the time and date have to be at least five days after booking the event. This provides the organizer enough leeway for preparation. Second, the time and date have to be either beyond office hours or on weekends. This is to accomodate the organizer's schedule as a full-time employee.

### Date Summary
To wrap it all up, a summary of all the previous sections will be presented in this section, for the user's convenience. Clicking on each box (tentative) will bring the user back to that section (e.g., if you click on the Activities, it will scroll back up to the Activities page).t

### Feedback Form
If the website lacks certain features and options, the user is free to use the feedback form to leave a review of the website so that adjustments can be made, according to the user's needs and wants.
